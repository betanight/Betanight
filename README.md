# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm a Data Science graduate from TripleTen Academy, currently growing my skills in Python, MySQL, and machine learning. I'm passionate about learning, building, and sharing my progress on GitHub.

## Skills
- **Data Science**: Statistical analysis, data manipulation, and exploration.
- **Python**: Proficient in Python for data analysis, machine learning, and text processing.
- **MySQL**: Experienced in working with databases and performing data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- **Machine Learning**: Applied machine learning techniques including supervised and unsupervised learning.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Text Processing Models**
I'm working on creating a GPT that can memorize books, specifically focusing on **Dungeons and Dragons modules**. This project involves advanced text processing techniques to understand and memorize large amounts of structured text.

### 2. **Customer Churn Prediction**
As part of my Data Science journey, I've worked on customer churn prediction models for telecom companies, utilizing Python and machine learning techniques like XGBoost to forecast customer retention based on historical data.

### 3. **Car Database Analysis**
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical data analysis (SDA), and building an interactive Streamlit application for filtering and visualizing car data based on various specifications and attributes.

## Learning Journey

My GitHub also showcases my learning journey from my time at TripleTen Academy, where I learned various topics from basic Python to advanced machine learning techniques. Some key areas I have worked on include:
